# LLM-Med-Extraction: Power Simulations for Medical Report Data Extraction

## Description
This project contains the power simulations for the evaluation of the accuracy Large Language Models (LLMs) in extracting structured data from medical reports. The simulations aim to compare the performance of LLM-based extraction methods against human coders. It will also contain the code and prompts used to communicate with the LLMs, as well as code for data-analysis.
