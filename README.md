# LLM-Med-Extraction: Power Simulations for Medical Report Data Extraction

## Description
This project focuses on conducting power simulations to evaluate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in extracting structured data from medical reports. The simulations aim to compare the performance of LLM-based extraction methods against human coders. The ultimate goal is to develop robust methodologies for leveraging LLMs to streamline and improve the accuracy of medical data extraction.

## Prerequisites
To run these simulations, you will need:
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 4.0 or higher recommended).
